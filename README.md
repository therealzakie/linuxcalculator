# Questions so you don't have to type
## Why does this exist??
This is only built as a calculator for platforms like Debian that have a complicated calculating system for people like me :( so I made this so calculation on Debian will be a bit simpiler (and for people who don't bother reading the documentation)
I'm not expecting this to get popular because it's very simple.
Anyways, thanks for using my little program :D
